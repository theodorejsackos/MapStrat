        <h2> What is MapStrat? </h2>
        <p> MapStrat is a drawing application built around the Player Unknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) map. It allows teams to
            strategize and discuss positions, player locations, and general game strategy before or after a game ends. </p>

        <h2> How does it work? </h2>
        <p> When you launch a MapStrat client you have a private drawing canvas. Use the menu bar to select "Session -> 
            Join Session ..." which will open a dialog for you to enter a group. Once connected, everyone connected to that 
            group will share the same drawing canvas. You can draw positions, movements, and other ideas on the map while you
            debrief with your team. When new members join the group they will receive all markings on the map. When all group
            members leave the session; all markings will be deleted and rejoining the session will produce an empty map.</p>
