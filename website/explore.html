        <h2> What is MapStrat? </h2>
        <p> MapStrat is a drawing application built around the Player Unknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) map. It allows teams to
            strategize and discuss positions, player locations, and general game strategy before or after a game ends. </p>

        <h2> How does it work? </h2>
        <p> When you launch a MapStrat client you have a private drawing canvas. Use the menu bar to select "Session -> 
            Join Session ..." which will open a dialog for you to enter a group. Once connected, everyone connected to that 
            group will share the same drawing canvas. You can draw positions, movements, and other ideas on the map while you
            debrief with your team. </p>
